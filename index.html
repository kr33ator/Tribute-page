          <h3>Basketball legacy</h3>
          <p>
            Bryant was called
            <b
              ><i
                >"one of the greatest players in the history of our game"
              </i></b
            >by NBA commissioner Adam Silver, and The New York Times wrote that
            he had "one of the most decorated careers in the history of the
            sport". 
            <p>
          Reuters called him
            <b><i>"arguably the best player of his generation"</i></b
            >, while both Sporting News and TNT named him their NBA player of
            the decade for the 2000s.</p>
             <p>In 2008 and again in 2016, ESPN ranked him
            the second-greatest shooting guard of all time after Jordan. Players
            including Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, and Derrick Rose
            called Bryant their generation's version of Jordan. 
            </p>
            <p>The
            Press-Enterprise described Bryant as
            <b
              ><i
                >"maybe the greatest Laker in the organization's history"</i
              ></b
            >. He was the Lakers' all-time leading scorer, and his five titles
            are tied for the most in franchise history. Both numbers he wore
            during his career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on December
            18, 2017.</p>

          <h3>Player profile</h3>
          <p>
            Bryant primarily played as a shooting guard. He was listed at 6 feet
            6 inches (1.98 m) and 212 pounds (96 kg), though Bryant himself said
            that he was 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m), or "probably" 6 feet 5 inches
            (1.96 m) in shoes.</p>
            <p> He was often cited as one of the most
            dangerous scorers in the NBA. Bryant has drawn frequent comparisons
            to Jordan, after whom he modeled his playing style. Like Jordan, he
            became most known for shooting a fall-away jump shot.</p>
            <p> Chris Ballard
            of Sports Illustrated described another of Bryant's most famous
            moves as the
            <b
              ><i><u>"jab step-and-pause"</u></i></b
            >: Bryant jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender
            relax, but instead of bringing the jab foot back, he pushed off of
            it and drove around his opponent to get to the basket.

          <h3>Career highlights and awards</h3>
          <p>
            Bryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total. The
            Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first eight
            games. In his ninth game of the season, playing against the
            Denver Nuggets, Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to
            reach 26,000 career points. Bryant also recorded his first
            triple-double since January 21, 2009.</p> 
            <p> On January 30 against the
            Celtics, he became the youngest player to score 27,000 points.
            On February 1, 2011, Bryant became one of seven players with at
            least 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists.

              <h3>Death</h3>
              <p>At 9:06 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter departed from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, with nine people aboard: Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, six family friends and the pilot. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California Secretary of State business database. The group was traveling to a basketball game at Bryant's Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks.</p>
              <p>Due to light rain and fog that morning, the LAPD helicopters and most other air traffic were grounded. The flight tracker showed that the helicopter circled above the L.A. Zoo due to heavy air traffic in the area. At 9:30 a.m. the pilot Ara Zobayan contacted the Burbank Airport's control tower, notifying the tower of the situation and was told he was "flying too low" to be tracked by radar. At that time, the helicopter experienced extreme fog and turned south towards the mountains. At 9:40 a.m. the helicopter climbed rapidly from 1,200 to 2,000 feet (370 to 610 m), flying at 161 knots (298 km/h; 185 mph).</p>
              <p>At 9:45 a.m., the helicopter crashed into the side of a mountain in Calabasas, about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and caught on fire. Bryant, his daughter, and the other seven occupants were killed. This also started a quarter-acre bush fire. At 9:47 a.m. authorities were called. Los Angeles County Fire Department firefighters responded to the scene, and paramedics rappelled from a helicopter to the scene to look for survivors. The fire was difficult to extinguish due to the presence of magnesium, but the fire had been extinguished by 10:30 a.m. Initial reports indicated that the helicopter crashed in the hills above Calabasas in heavy fog. Witnesses reported hearing a helicopter struggling before crashing.</p>
              <p>The cause of the crash is still unknown, as the helicopter was not equipped with a black box. The Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, and the FBI have launched investigations into the crash.</p>
